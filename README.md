# Stem

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Stem programming language (working title)!

Stem is an interpretted, object-oriented programming language written to simplify
and extend the object-oriented programming paradigm common to many programmers and developers today.

## Why Stem?

_Stem introduces a diverse and powerful type system that follows a more controlled runtime engine._

Stem presents a language that has some of the elogance and simplicity found in JavaScript. One difference between other languages is the runtime. In many other OOP languages, classes are used to access memory through pointers or "references" to a location in memory. To the programmer's disadvantage, he/she may not be aware of what happens to that memory behind the text. Stem aims at making developers using the language more aware of these changes while being easy to read and understand. The details of this process will be addressed later, though (see [Current Status](#current-status) for details.)

## Current Status

_Updates on the latest changes will be posted here._

With the project still going through its development stage, documentation is scarce. Some documentation, tutorials, and explanations will be posted in a couple weeks' time.

The project is not yet ready for release, although the source code is available for download. It uses Microsoft's .NET Core framework, making it cross-platform and usable on any machine with the latest .NET Core runtime installed.
